﻿<h1>Encrypted Notebook (written in C#)</h1>

## Important Info!
This is a project of mine, which I have released for further 
development or similar, i.e. I am not liable if important information 
of yours remains encrypted forever! You are responsible for yourselves!


## Application description:

This is not a normal notebook, this is an encrypted notebook 
where you are the master of your data. Because you have to 
host your own DB-Server (Maria/MySQL)! And don't forget, all 
important data is hashed or encrypted, with SHA512 or AES256 (with salt).


## How to Set-Up the Database:
Don't worry, it's not difficult, only the following data are requested 
at the start of the program (Server-Ip, Username, Password and a 
database name). Just enter them and press the button. Everything 
will be automatically set up for you and then you can directly create a user.
